            <h3>-a, --archive</h3>
            <p>This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything.
            <p>Note however that -a does not preserve hardlinks, because finding multiply-linked files is expensive. You must separately specify -H.</p>

            <h3>-v, --verbose</h3>
            <p>This option increases the amount of information you are given during the transfer.  By default, rsync works silently.  A single -v will give you information about what files are being transferred and a brief summary at the end.  Two -v flags will give you information on what files are being skipped and slightly more information at the end.  More than two -v flags should only be used if you are debugging rsync.</p>

            <h3>-L, --copy-links</h3>
            <p>When symlinks are encountered, the file that they point to is copied, rather than the symlink.</p>

            <h3>-r, --recursive</h3>
